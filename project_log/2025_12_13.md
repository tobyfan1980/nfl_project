# Project Log - December 13, 2025

## Today's Progress

### Model Definition
- Defined `NFLModel1` class in `model.py` with two key rating methods:
  - **Offensive Rating**: Calculates offensive performance based on yards and points scored
  - **Defensive Rating**: Calculates defensive performance based on opponent's yards, points, and turnovers

### Rating Calculation Program
- Created `calculate_rating_per_game.py` to process game data:
  - Reads game data from CSV files (e.g., `dev_data/2022_games.csv`)
  - Extracts game statistics (scores, yards, turnovers, home/away status)
  - Calculates offensive and defensive ratings for each team per game
  - Outputs results to `dev_data/2022_game_ratings.csv` with columns:
    - `team`: Team name
    - `score`: Points scored
    - `win_lose`: Win/Loss indicator
    - `home_away`: Home/Away indicator
    - `offensive_rating`: Calculated offensive rating
    - `defensive_rating`: Calculated defensive rating

### Model Evaluation
- Used Excel to generate correlation tables from the calculated ratings
- Observed and evaluated the model's performance
- Analyzed relationships between ratings and game outcomes

## Next Steps

### Model Refinement
The next phase focuses on improving the model to achieve better correlation results:
- **Goal**: Refine `offensive_rating` and `defensive_rating` formulas to produce better correlation tables
- **Approach**: 
  - Adjust coefficients in existing formulas
  - Consider adding additional parameters to the calculations
  - Evaluate which factors most significantly impact game outcomes

### Homework Assignment
**For Aidan and Kevin:**
- **Task**: Consider what parameters might be needed to improve the model
- **Questions to explore**:
  - What additional game statistics could enhance the rating calculations?
  - How should coefficients be adjusted in the current formulas?
  - What factors are most predictive of team performance?
  - Should home/away status have a different weighting?
  - Are there other metrics (e.g., time of possession, red zone efficiency) that should be incorporated?

## Notes
- All data files are organized in the `dev_data/` folder
- The rating calculation program processes games line by line, creating two rows per game (one for each team)
- Current model formulas are defined in `model.py` and can be adjusted for refinement
